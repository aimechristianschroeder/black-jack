This is a small black jack game, which uses tkinter as a graphical user 
interface.

Custom Rules:
Each time an ace is played it's value is either 11 or 1 if the player would've gone bust
otherwise.
The dealer takes cards as long as his score is below 17.
When both player and dealer have the same score, it's a draw.
When one of the players hits the score 21 he automatically won the game.

This is a test repo and there will probably be no future commits.
